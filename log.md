**Today's Progress**: Did a few Leetcode problems on arrays and finished MIT course  1. Algorithmic thinking, peak finding on YT. 
Refreshed and got some clarity on Time complexity
 
Did a few challenges on http://mytechinterviews.com. They ALWAYS trip me up!


**Thoughts:** I think some things with Leetcode got clearer after the video. So it did provide a bit of insight even though I wS SKEPTICAL

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January  20, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
